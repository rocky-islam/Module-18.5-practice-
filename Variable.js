    1. What is JavaScript?
    Ans: It is the programming language for the web. it can update and change both html and css. it can calculate manipulate and validate data. 
    JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

    2. How Does Javascript work?
    Ans: When the browser loads the page, the browser has a built-in interpreter that reads the JavaScript code it finds in the page and runs it.

    3.What is variable?
    Ans: Variable means anything that can vary. In JavaScript, a variable stores the data value that can be changed later on. Use the reserved keyword var to declare a variable in JavaScript.

    4. Declare a Variable?
    Ans: Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable. You declare a JavaScript variable with the var or the let keyword: var carName;.
    exp: var carName="Audi";

    5. Type of Variable. How can you find variable?
    Ans: In JavaScript there are 5 different data types that can contain values:
    * string
    * number
    * boolean
    * object
    * function
    
    the typeof operator is used to find the type of a variable, object, or method. The typeof operator returns one of the following types: number, boolean, object, string, undefined, function.


    6.Primitive and non primitive data type?
    Ans:The Primitive Data types in JavaScript include Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null and Symbol. The Non-Primitive data type has only one member i.e. the Object.

    7. Naming convention of javascript?
    Ans: we use camelCase for identifier names (variables and functions).
    All names start with a letter.

    8. Math operation +,-,*,/,%?
    Ans: Addition operator (+) {
        let x = 5;
        let y = 2;
        let z = x + y;
    }

    subtraction operator (-){
        let x = 5;
        let y = 2;
        let z = x - y;
    }

    multiplication operator(*){
        let x = 5;
        let y = 2;
        let z = x * y;
    }

    dividing operator(/){
        let x = 5;
        let y = 2;
        let z = x / y;
    }

    modular operator(%){
        let x = 5;
        let y = 2;
        let z = x % y;
    }

    9. Short Hand += -= *= /=?
    Ans: Operator 	Example 	Same As
            +=         x+=y        x=x+y
            -=         x-=y        x=x-y
            *=         x*=y        x=x*y
            /=         x/=y        x=x/y
            

    10. ++ --?
    Ans: The increment operator (++) increments numbers.
    Example
    let x = 5;
    x++;
    let z = x; 

    The decrement operator (--) decrements numbers.
    Example
    let x = 5;
    x--;
    let z = x;

    11. ParseInt and parseFloat?
    Ans:parseInt is for converting a non integer number to an int and parseFloat is for converting a non float (with out a decimal) to a float (with a decimal).

    12. toFixed?
    Ans:The toFixed() method converts a number to a string. The toFixed() method rounds the string to a specified number of decimals.
